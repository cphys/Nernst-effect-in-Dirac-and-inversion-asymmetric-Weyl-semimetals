# Nernst effect in Dirac and inversion-asymmetric Weyl semimetals

Mathematica code which will give the eigenvalues and berry curvature

## Instructions
* running mathematica codes will output plots to directory in which the code is located

## To Do
* need to add calculation of nernst effect to archive
* Berry Curvature can probably be optimized a little further using parallelization
* Test calculating Berry curvature numerically in mathematica to increase speed
* output analytical solutions in Berry curvature

## Acknowledgments
* this code was developed in support of https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.96.195119

* method for obtaining nernst coefficient can be found https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.93.035116
